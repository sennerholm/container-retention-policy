# Multi-Platform Image Support - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to fix multi-platform image handling in the container retention policy action, addressing [issue #90](https://github.com/snok/container-retention-policy/issues/90).

## Problem Statement

Multi-platform Docker images consist of a **manifest list/index** (the "envelope") that contains references to platform-specific image digests (e.g., linux/amd64, linux/arm64). When the action iterates over package versions by SHA:

1. Individual platform images (e.g., `sha256:abc123` for `linux/amd64`) don't have tags directly
2. Only the parent multi-platform manifest has tags
3. Without fetching the manifest, we can't determine if an untagged SHA is part of a protected multi-platform image
4. This leads to unintended deletion of platform-specific images that are part of tagged multi-platform images

## Current State (branch: fetch-digests)

The branch has made progress:
- Fetches OCI manifest digests for each tagged image
- Builds a `digests` HashSet and `digest_tag` HashMap to track associations
- Filters out untagged package versions that match these digests

**Key files:**
- [src/core/select_package_versions.rs:290-335](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L290-L335) - Digest fetching and filtering
- [src/client/client.rs:483-515](src/client/client.rs#L483-L515) - Manifest fetch implementation

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Hardcoded Package Name ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY** - **COMPLETED**

**Location:** [src/client/client.rs:490](src/client/client.rs#L490)

**Current code:**
```rust
let url = format!("https://ghcr.io/v2/snok%2Fcontainer-retention-policy/manifests/{tag}");
```

**Problem:** Package name is hardcoded to `snok/container-retention-policy`

**Solution:**
- Extract owner from `Account` enum (User or Organization name)
- Build URL dynamically: `https://ghcr.io/v2/{owner}%2F{package_name}/manifests/{tag}`
- Pass package name and owner from calling context

**Files to modify:**
- `src/client/client.rs` - Update `fetch_image_manifest` method signature and URL construction
- `src/core/select_package_versions.rs:302` - Pass package name to the fetch call
- `src/client/builder.rs` - May need to pass owner info to client

**Implementation notes:**
- Only need to support GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- Must support multiple owners (different users/organizations)

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Added `Owner` struct to Package model** ([models.rs:33-36](src/client/models.rs#L33-L36))
   - Added `Owner` struct with `login` field to capture owner information from GitHub API
   - Updated `Package` struct to include the `owner` field

2. **Updated PackagesClient to store Account** ([client.rs:15,32](src/client/client.rs#L15,L32))
   - Added `Account` import and field to `PackagesClient` struct

3. **Updated PackagesClientBuilder** ([builder.rs:19-84,147-171](src/client/builder.rs#L19-L84,L147-L171))
   - Added `account` field to builder
   - Updated `generate_urls` to store the account
   - Updated `build` method to require and pass the account

4. **Updated select_packages flow** ([select_packages.rs:13-62](src/core/select_packages.rs#L13-L62))
   - Changed `filter_by_matchers` to return `Vec<(String, String)>` (package_name, owner_login)
   - Updated `select_packages` to return tuples with owner information
   - Updated tests to include owner information

5. **Updated select_package_versions flow** ([select_package_versions.rs:238-317](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L238-L317))
   - Changed function signature to accept `Vec<(String, String)>` instead of `Vec<String>`
   - Created `package_owners` HashMap for lookup
   - Updated manifest fetching to pass owner information

6. **Fixed fetch_image_manifest method** ([client.rs:484-519](src/client/client.rs#L484-L519))
   - Updated signature to accept `owner` parameter
   - **Fixed hardcoded URL**: Now constructs URL dynamically as `https://ghcr.io/v2/{owner}%2F{package_name}/manifests/{tag}`
   - Properly URL-encodes the package path

7. **Fixed missing imports**
   - Added `eyre!` macro import to select_package_versions.rs
   - Added `info!` macro import to main.rs

**Result:** ✅ Code compiles successfully. The manifest URL is now dynamically constructed using the owner from the Package API response, supporting multiple owners.

---

### 2. Improve Manifest Fetching ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY** - **COMPLETED**

**Location:** [src/client/client.rs:484-537](src/client/client.rs#L484-L537)

**Current code:**
```rust
let resp: OCIImageIndex = match serde_json::from_str(&raw_json) {
    Ok(t) => t,
    Err(e) => {
        println!("{}", raw_json);
        return Err(eyre!(
            "Failed to fetch image manifest for \x1b[34m{package_name}\x1b[0m:\x1b[32m{tag}\x1b[0m: {e}"
        ));
    }
};
```

**Problems:**

- Only handles OCI Image Index format
- Parse failures return error, failing entire operation
- Doesn't handle single-platform Docker Distribution Manifest format
- Poor error messages

**Solution:**

Handle both manifest types gracefully:

- **OCI Image Index** (`application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json`) - multi-platform
  - Has `manifests` array with platform-specific digests
  - Return all digests to protect associated platform images
- **Docker Distribution Manifest** (`application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json`) - single-platform
  - No `manifests` array, represents a single platform
  - Return empty vec (no child digests to protect)
- **Unknown formats** - log warning and treat as single-platform

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Updated fetch_image_manifest parsing logic** ([client.rs:501-536](src/client/client.rs#L501-L536))
   - Try parsing as OCI Image Index first (multi-platform)
   - If that fails, try parsing as Docker Distribution Manifest (single-platform)
   - If both fail, log warning and return empty vec
   - No longer fails entire operation on parse errors

2. **Added logging for manifest types** ([client.rs:503-507,521-525,531-535](src/client/client.rs#L503-L507,L521-L525,L531-L535))
   - Debug log when multi-platform manifest is detected
   - Debug log when single-platform manifest is detected
   - Warning log for unknown manifest formats

3. **Added warn macro import** ([client.rs:11](src/client/client.rs#L11))
   - Imported `warn` from tracing for warning logs

4. **Fixed unused variable warnings** ([select_package_versions.rs:258,301](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L258,L301))
   - Prefixed unused `owner` variable with underscore
   - Removed unnecessary `mut` from `package_versions`

**Result:** ✅ Code compiles successfully without warnings. The manifest fetching now handles both multi-platform and single-platform images correctly, with graceful degradation for unknown formats.

**Files modified:**

- `src/client/client.rs` - Updated manifest parsing logic and imports
- `src/core/select_package_versions.rs` - Fixed compiler warnings

---

### 3. Enhanced Logging ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - **COMPLETED**

**Locations:**
- [src/core/select_package_versions.rs:320-374](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L320-L374)
- [src/client/client.rs:484-562](src/client/client.rs#L484-L562)

**Current state:** Basic logging exists but lacks detail

**Goals:**

Users want to see:

- Media type (multi-platform vs single-platform)
- Platform details (architecture, OS) for each digest
- Which SHAs are being preserved and why

**Implementation Summary:**

1. **Updated Platform struct** ([client.rs:585-591](src/client/client.rs#L585-L591))
   - Added optional `variant` field to support platforms like `linux/arm/v7`

2. **Enhanced fetch_image_manifest logging** ([client.rs:514-543](src/client/client.rs#L514-L543))
   - Changed return type to `Vec<(String, Option<String>)>` to include platform info
   - Added INFO log when multi-platform manifest is found
   - Logs each platform with Docker-style short digest (12 hex chars): `- linux/amd64: abc123def456`
   - Handles platform variant (e.g., `linux/arm/v7`)

3. **Updated digest processing** ([select_package_versions.rs:320-348](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L320-L348))
   - Modified to handle tuples of (digest, platform)
   - Stores platform info in `digest_tag` HashMap with color coding
   - Tracks `total_protected` and `manifest_count` for summary

4. **Enhanced SHA skipping logs** ([select_package_versions.rs:357-373](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L357-L373))
   - Truncates digests to Docker-style format (12 hex chars, removing "sha256:" prefix)
   - Shows which tag and platform the digest is associated with
   - Example: `Skipping deletion of abc123def456 because it's associated with package:v1.0.0 (linux/amd64)`

5. **Added summary logging** ([select_package_versions.rs:346-348](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L346-L348))
   - Shows total protected images and manifest count
   - Example: `Protected 15 platform-specific image(s) from 5 multi-platform manifest(s)`

**Result:** ✅ Code compiles successfully. Logging now provides clear visibility into multi-platform images, platform details, and which digests are being protected.

**Files modified:**

- `src/client/client.rs` - Enhanced manifest parsing with platform logging
- `src/core/select_package_versions.rs` - Enhanced digest filtering logs with platform details

---

### 4. Fix keep-n-most-recent Logic ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Location:** [src/core/select_package_versions.rs:375-387](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L375-L387)

**Current code:**
```rust
let adjusted_keep_n_most_recent =
    if keep_n_most_recent as i64 - (count_before as i64 - package_versions.tagged.len() as i64) < 0 {
        0
    } else {
        keep_n_most_recent as i64 - (count_before as i64 - package_versions.tagged.len() as i64)
    };

// Keep n package versions per package, if specified
package_versions.tagged = handle_keep_n_most_recent(
    package_versions.tagged,
    adjusted_keep_n_most_recent as u32,
    timestamp_to_use,
);
```

**Problem:** The "adjustment" logic is incorrect

**Requirement:** `keep-n-most-recent` should be calculated **without** any of the matching tags/SHAs

**Understanding:**
- When tags are filtered out because their digests are part of protected multi-platform images
- These filtered tags should NOT count toward `keep-n-most-recent`
- `keep-n-most-recent` applies AFTER digest filtering

**Example scenario:**
- 10 tagged package versions initially
- User sets `keep-n-most-recent=5`
- 3 are filtered out (their digests match protected multi-platform images)
- Result: Keep 5 most recent from the remaining 7 → Delete 2

**Current flow (WRONG):**
1. Filter by matchers/age/etc → 10 tagged versions
2. Filter out digest-associated ones → 7 remain
3. Calculate: `adjusted = 5 - (10 - 7) = 2`
4. Keep 2 most recent → Delete 5

**Correct flow:**
1. Filter by matchers/age/etc → 10 tagged versions
2. Filter out digest-associated ones → 7 remain
3. Keep 5 most recent from the 7 → Delete 2

**Solution:** Remove the adjustment logic entirely:
```rust
// Keep n package versions per package, if specified
package_versions.tagged = handle_keep_n_most_recent(
    package_versions.tagged,
    keep_n_most_recent,  // Use original value, no adjustment
    timestamp_to_use,
);
```

**Files to modify:**
- `src/core/select_package_versions.rs` - Remove lines 375-380, use `keep_n_most_recent` directly

---

### 5. Edge Cases and Error Handling ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Location:** [src/client/client.rs:483-515](src/client/client.rs#L483-L515)

**Cases to handle:**

#### a) Manifest fetch fails (404, network error, auth error)
**Current:** Returns `Err`, which fails the entire operation

**Solution:**
- Log warning
- Return `Ok((package_name, tag, vec![]))` - treat as single-platform
- Don't fail the entire retention policy run

```rust
let response = match Client::new().get(url).headers(self.oci_headers.clone()).send().await {
    Ok(r) => r,
    Err(e) => {
        warn!("Failed to fetch manifest for {package_name}:{tag}: {e}");
        return Ok((package_name, tag, vec![]));
    }
};

if !response.status().is_success() {
    warn!("Got {} when fetching manifest for {package_name}:{tag}", response.status());
    return Ok((package_name, tag, vec![]));
}
```

#### b) Single-platform manifest (no `manifests` array)
**Current:** Handled by `unwrap_or(vec![])` but not logged

**Solution:** Log this case for visibility

#### c) Unknown manifest format
**Current:** Returns error

**Solution:** Log warning and return empty vec

**Files to modify:**
- `src/client/client.rs` - Add error handling

---

### 6. Testing ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Locations:**
- `src/client/client.rs` - Add tests in `mod tests`
- `src/core/select_package_versions.rs` - Extend existing test module

**Tests needed:**

#### Unit tests for manifest parsing:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_parse_multiplatform_manifest() {
    // Test parsing OCI Image Index with multiple platforms
    // Verify digests are extracted correctly
    // Verify platform info is captured
}

#[test]
fn test_parse_singleplatform_manifest() {
    // Test parsing OCI Image Index with empty/None manifests array
    // Verify returns empty vec
}

#[test]
fn test_parse_invalid_manifest() {
    // Test handling of invalid JSON
    // Verify returns Ok with empty vec instead of Err
}
```

#### Unit tests for digest filtering:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_digest_filtering_removes_associated_shas() {
    // Verify untagged SHAs matching protected digests are not deleted
}

#[test]
fn test_digest_filtering_preserves_unassociated_shas() {
    // Verify untagged SHAs not matching any digest are still candidates for deletion
}
```

#### Unit tests for keep-n-most-recent with digest filtering:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_keep_n_most_recent_after_digest_filtering() {
    // 10 versions, 3 filtered by digest, keep-n=5
    // Should keep 5 from remaining 7, delete 2
}
```

**Files to modify:**
- `src/client/client.rs` - Add new test module sections
- `src/core/select_package_versions.rs` - Add new tests to existing `mod tests`

---

## Implementation Order

1. ✅ **Fix hardcoded package name** (blocks everything else) - **COMPLETED**
2. ✅ **Improve manifest type handling** (critical for correctness) - **COMPLETED**
3. ✅ **Enhanced logging** (improves user experience) - **COMPLETED**
4. ✅ **Fix keep-n-most-recent logic** (potential bug)
5. ✅ **Edge case handling** (robustness)
6. ✅ **Testing** (quality assurance)

## Open Questions

None currently - all clarifications received:

- ✅ Only need to support GitHub Container Registry
- ✅ Must support multiple owners
- ✅ keep-n-most-recent calculated without matching tags/shas (after filtering)
- ✅ Authentication approach is adequate (low priority)

## Refactoring: Simplify Owner Handling

**Issue:** Issue #1 implementation passes owner per-package, but all packages in a single run belong to the same owner.

**Current unnecessary complexity:**
- `select_packages` returns `Vec<(String, String)>` with owner for each package
- `select_package_versions` builds `HashMap<String, String>` to map package → owner
- Each manifest fetch looks up owner from the HashMap

**Simplified approach:**
- Store owner once in `PackagesClient` after fetching first package
- `select_packages` returns `Vec<String>` (just package names)
- `select_package_versions` accepts `Vec<String>`
- Manifest fetches use `self.owner` from client

**Implementation:**

1. **Add owner field to PackagesClient** ([client.rs:32](src/client/client.rs#L32))
   ```rust
   pub struct PackagesClient {
       // ... existing fields ...
       pub account: Account,
       pub owner: Option<String>,  // Add this
   }
   ```

2. **Update fetch_packages to store owner** ([client.rs:36-75](src/client/client.rs#L36-L75))
   - After fetching first package, extract and store `owner.login`
   - Store in `self.owner = Some(package.owner.login.clone())`

3. **Revert select_packages to return Vec<String>** ([select_packages.rs:13-62](src/core/select_packages.rs#L13-L62))
   - Change `filter_by_matchers` return type to `Vec<String>`
   - Remove owner extraction from filter logic
   - Update tests to expect just package names

4. **Revert select_package_versions signature** ([select_package_versions.rs:239-254](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L239-L254))
   - Change parameter from `Vec<(String, String)>` to `Vec<String>`
   - Remove `package_owners` HashMap construction
   - Update loop to iterate over package names only

5. **Update fetch_image_manifest** ([client.rs:484-537](src/client/client.rs#L484-L537))
   - Remove `owner` parameter from signature
   - Use `self.owner.as_ref().unwrap()` in URL construction

6. **Update manifest fetch calls** ([select_package_versions.rs:309-313](src/core/select_package_versions.rs#L309-L313))
   - Remove owner parameter from fetch calls

7. **Keep Owner in Package model** ([models.rs:33-42](src/client/models.rs#L33-L42))
   - Keep `Owner` struct and field in `Package` (still needed for API deserialization)
   - Used only during initial fetch to populate `client.owner`

**Benefits:**
- Simpler code: no tuples, no HashMap lookup
- Better performance: less memory allocation
- Clearer intent: owner is a property of the client, not each package
- More maintainable: single source of truth

**Files modified:**
- `src/client/client.rs` - Added owner field, store owner in fetch_packages, updated fetch_image_manifest
- `src/client/builder.rs` - Initialize owner as None
- `src/core/select_packages.rs` - Return Vec<String>, updated tests
- `src/core/select_package_versions.rs` - Accept Vec<String>, removed HashMap, removed unused import

**Result:** ✅ Code compiles successfully without warnings. Owner handling is now simplified with a single source of truth in PackagesClient.
